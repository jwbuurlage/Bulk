Bulk is a novel interface for writing BSP programs in the C++ programming language that leverages modern C++ features to allow for the implementation of safe and generic parallel algorithms for shared-memory, distributed-memory, and hybrid systems. This interface targets the next generation of BSP programmers who want to write fast, safe, clear and portable parallel programs. About BSP The bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) programming model, is a way of writing parallel and distributed programs. BSP is the underlying model for Bulk. Instead of communicating between processors (or nodes, or cores) asynchronously, all communication is staged and resolved at fixed synchronization points . These synchronizations delimit so-called supersteps . This way of structuring parallel programs has a number of advantages: The resulting programs are structured , easy to understand and maintain, and their performance and correctness can be reasoned about. Data races are eliminated almost by construction, because of simple rules which can be enforced at runtime. Scalability is straightforward to obtain. Programs are written in a SPMD fashion. There are only two types of communication mechanisms , message passing and named communication (through distributed variables) . This makes BSP based libraries very economic: you can accomplish a lot with very little. It has a gentle learning curve . It is easy to write correct BSP programs, while it is notoriously hard to write correct asynchronous parallel programs. Examples Hello world! bulk :: thread :: environment env ; env . spawn ( env . available_processors (), []( auto world ) { auto s = world . rank (); auto p = world . active_processors (); world . log ( Hello world from processor %d / %d! , s , p ); }); Distributed variables are the bread and butter of communication in Bulk. auto a = bulk :: var int ( world ); a ( world . next_rank ()) = s ; world . sync (); // ... a is now updated auto b = a ( world . next_rank ()). get (); world . sync (); // ... b.value() is now available Coarrays are convenient distributed arrays. auto xs = bulk :: coarray int ( world , 10 ); xs ( world . next_rank ())[ 3 ] = s ; Message passing can be used for more flexible communication. auto q = bulk :: queue int , float ( world ); for ( int t = 0 ; t p ; ++ t ) { q ( t ). send ( s , 3.1415f ); // send (s, pi) to processor t } world . sync (); // messages are now available in q for ( auto [ tag , content ] : q ) { world . log ( %d got sent %d, %f \\n , s , tag , content ); } Building Bulk requires Linux and an up-to-date compiler, that supports C++17, e.g. GCC = 7.0, or Clang = 4.0. Backends Bulk supports a number of different backends , allowing the programs to run in parallel using: thread for multi-core systems using standard C++ thread threading support mpi for distributed environments using MPI There is also a special legacy backend available for the Epiphany coprocessor , which can be found in the epiphany branch. This branch has a modified version of Bulk to support portability between MPI, thread and the Epiphany coprocessor. See backends/epiphany/README.md for more details. Examples The examples in the examples directory work for every backend. To build them, do the following. The backends (e.g. thread , mpi ) are built optionally, just remove or add the option if you do not require them. mkdir build cd build cmake .. make thread mpi The examples will be compiled in the bin/{backend} directory, prepended with the backend name, i.e. to run the hello example with the thread backend: ./bin/thread/thread_hello Developing on top of Bulk The easiest way to get started using Bulk is to download the source code from GitHub . If you use Bulk in a project we suggest to add Bulk as a submodule: git submodule add https://www.github.com/jwbuurlage/bulk ext/bulk git submodule update --init If you use CMake for your project, adding Bulk as a dependency is straightforward. For this, you can use the bulk and bulk_[backend] targets. For example, if your CMake target is called your_program and it uses Bulk with the thread backend, you can use the following: add_subdirectory ( ext/bulk ) target_link_libraries ( your_program bulk_thread ) License Bulk is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE.md.

The BSP model is intended as a bridging model between parallel hardware and software. It is an elegant and simple model that has a small and easy to understand interface. The BSP model is defined on an abstract computer called a BSP computer. This computer has three important requirements. It has p p processors capable of computation and communication, i.e. it allows for local memory transactions. It has a network in place that allows the different processors to send and receive data. It has a mechanism that allows for the synchronisation of these processors, e.g. by means of a blocking barrier. A BSP program consists of a number of distinct blocks of computation and communication called supersteps . These steps are separated by a barrier synchronisation, and consist of a computation and a communication step. An important part of a BSP algorithm is the associated cost function. To this end we introduce two important concepts: namely an h h -relation, and a notion of the work done by a processor. Furthermore we introduce two parameters that define a BSP computer: g g and l l . An h h -relation is a superstep in which each processor sends or receives a maximum of h h words of data. We commonly denote with s s the id of a processor such that we can write for the h h -relation: h = \\max_s \\left\\{ \\max \\{ (h_s)_\\text{sent}, (h_s)_\\text{received} \\}~|~\\text{processors } s \\right\\} h = \\max_s \\left\\{ \\max \\{ (h_s)_\\text{sent}, (h_s)_\\text{received} \\}~|~\\text{processors } s \\right\\} Where h_s h_s denotes the number of words received or sent by processor s s . Similarly we define the work w w done in a superstep as the maximum number of flops, floating point operations, performed by all processors. Finally we define the latency l l of a superstep as the fixed constant overhead, used primarily to account for the barrier synchronisation. The values for g g and l l are platform-specific constants that are found emperically. The values for w w and h h are superstep specific and commonly obtained analytically. The total BSP cost associated to a BSP algorithm is: T = \\sum_{\\text{supersteps } i} (w_i + g \\cdot h_i + l) T = \\sum_{\\text{supersteps } i} (w_i + g \\cdot h_i + l) The BSP model has gained significant interest in the last couple of years. Most notably because Google has adopted the model and has developed some technologies based on BSP such as MapReduce and Pregel. The standard for BSP implementations is BSPlib . Modern implementations of the BSPlib include BSPonMPI, which simulates the BSP model on top of MPI, and MulticoreBSP, which provides a BSP implementation for shared-memory multi-core computers. For a more detailed introduction on the BSP model, as well as a large number of examples of BSP programs we refer to the introductory textbook on BSP and MPI by Rob Bisseling.

No global state In BSPlib, the SPMD section is delimited using bsp_begin() and bsp_end() calls. In Bulk, the SPMD section is passed as an argument to the environment::spawn function. // BSPlib #include bsp.h int main () { bsp_begin ( bsp_nprocs ()); int s = bsp_pid (); int p = bsp_nprocs (); printf ( Hello World from processor %d / %d , s , p ); bsp_end (); return 0 ; } // Bulk #include bulk/bulk.hpp #include bulk/backends/mpi/mpi.hpp int main () { bulk :: mpi :: environment env ; env . spawn ( env . available_processors (), []( auto world ) { auto s = world . rank (); auto p = world . active_processors (); world . log ( Hello world from processor %d / %d! , s , p ); }); } When using BSPlib, all calls to the parallel system happen globally. In particular, calls such as bsp_sync() and bsp_push_reg(...) implicitly modify some global state. In Bulk, the state is captured in a world object. Besides the well-known reasons not to use global state, this allows for multi-layered parallelism. For example, one world could contain the nodes in an MPI cluster, while another world represents the multi-core system on such a node. Registration of variables Variables and message queues are registered and initialized upon creation, and deregistered when they go out of scope. This means that explicit registration calls are no longer necessary. Compare: // BSPlib int x = 0 ; bsp_push_reg ( x , sizeof ( int )); bsp_sync (); ... bsp_pop_reg ( x ); // Bulk auto x = bulk :: var int ( world ); Communication Communication using simple distributed variables is expressed more compactly in Bulk. Compare: // BSPlib int b = 3 ; bsp_put (( s + 1 ) % p , b , x , 0 , sizeof ( int )); int c = 0 ; bsp_get (( s + 1 ) % p , x , 0 , c , sizeof ( int )); bsp_sync (); // Bulk x ( world . next_rank ()) = 3 ; auto c = x ( world . next_rank ()). get (); world . sync (); Arrays Bulk treats distributed arrays differently from simple values. This is done using coarrays. Compare: // BSPlib int * xs = malloc ( 10 * sizeof ( int )); bsp_push_reg ( xs , 10 * sizeof ( int )); bsp_sync (); int ys [ 3 ] = { 1 , 2 , 3 }; bsp_put (( s + 1 ) % p , ys , xs , 2 , 3 * sizeof ( int )); int z = 5 ; bsp_put (( s + 1 ) % p , z , xs , 0 , sizeof ( int )); bsp_sync (); ... bsp_pop_reg ( xs ); free ( xs ); // Bulk auto xs = bulk :: coarray int ( world , 10 ); xs ( world . next_rank ())[{ 2 , 5 }] = { 2 , 3 , 4 }; xs ( world . next_rank ())[ 0 ] = 5 ; world . sync (); Message passing In BSPlib, messages consist of a tag and a content . In Bulk, we don t force this message structure, but we do support it. Compare: // BSPlib int s = bsp_pid (); int p = bsp_nprocs (); int tagsize = sizeof ( int ); bsp_set_tagsize ( tagsize ); bsp_sync (); int tag = 1 ; int payload = 42 + s ; bsp_send (( s + 1 ) % p , tag , payload , sizeof ( int )); bsp_sync (); int packets = 0 ; int accum_bytes = 0 ; bsp_qsize ( packets , accum_bytes ); int payload_in = 0 ; int payload_size = 0 ; int tag_in = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i packets ; ++ i ) { bsp_get_tag ( payload_size , tag_in ); bsp_move ( payload_in , sizeof ( int )); printf ( payload: %i, tag: %i , payload_in , tag_in ); } // Bulk auto s = world . rank (); auto p = world . active_processors (); auto q = bulk :: queue int , int ( world ); q ( world . next_rank ()). send ( 1 , 42 + s ); world . sync (); for ( auto [ tag , content ] : queue ) { world . log ( payload: %i, tag: %i , content , tag ); } In addition, Bulk supports sending arbitrary data either using custom structs, or by composing messages on the fly. For example, to send a 3D tensor element with indices and its value, we can write: auto q = bulk :: queue int , int , int , float ( world ); q ( world . next_rank ()). send ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.0f ); world . sync (); for ( auto [ i , j , k , value ] : queue ) { world . log ( element: A(%i, %i, %i) = %f , i , j , k , value ); } Also, multiple queues can be constructed, which eliminates a common use case for using tags.

For example, in the simulation of physical systems typically the grid size is chosen as fine as computational considerations allow for, and linear systems containing millions of equations and unknowns are solved routinely. In this tutorial, we will discuss the implementation of a number of important parallel algorithms in scientific computing. The algorithms we consider are those explained in Parallel Scientific Computing by Rob Bisseling . Implementations of these algorithms in BSPlib can be found in BSPedupack . Our discussion is stand-alone, however the focus is on the implementation of these algorithms in Bulk, and not the derivation or detailed description of the algorithms. The result of our efforts will be a library that contains support for important objects in parallel scientific computing: Distributed vector Distributed matrix (dense and sparse) The algorithms we will implement are (in order): Computing the inner product of two vectors Sorting a vector Computing the LU decomposition of a matrix Our intentions are educational, we will strive to design simple implementations of the algorithm and will not optimize for specific hardware, or e.g. exploit hybrid systems. Although we do not develop the algorithms for maximum performance, we will make sure that all our algorithms exhibit good scaling behavior. In most source code examples, we assume that we have the following aliases: auto s = world . rank (); auto p = world . active_processors (); The full source code is available in examples/psc starting from Bulk version v1.2.0. Note that this code may be slightly different from what we discuss here, for clarity of presentation, or because it has been updated. the psc::vector class: the humble beginnings of our library Before we are ready to describe and implement our first BSP algorithm, we will first define a distributed vector object. Since we will require multiple data distributions for the various algorithms we will implement, we will not assume any fixed one. The design of the vector object should be clear from the following example: env . spawn ( env . available_processors (), [ ]( bulk :: world world ) { auto s = world . rank (); auto p = world . active_processors (); // we choose n = 1e6 auto size = 1000000 ; // as an example, we take a cyclic partitioning auto pi = bulk :: cyclic_partitioning 1 ({ size }, { p }); auto v = psc :: vector int ( world , pi ); auto w = psc :: vector int ( world , pi ); // ... fill with data // compute the inner product auto alpha = psc :: dot ( v , w ); // we output the result world . log ( %i , alpha ); }); A partitioning pi is associated to a distributed vector. In this case, the components of the vector are integers. A psc::vector is defined as follows. namespace psc { template typename T class vector { //... Everything we define will be in a parallel scientific computing ( psc ) namespace. We make a generic implementation, that works for any T . A constructor for the vector class can look something like the following. private : bulk :: world world_ ; bulk :: partitioning 1 partitioning_ ; bulk :: coarray T data_ ; public : vector ( bulk :: world world , bulk :: partitioning 1 partitioning ) : world_ ( world ), partitioning_ ( partitioning ), data_ ( world_ , partitioning . local_count ( world_ . rank ()), ( T ) 0 ) {} // ... A vector object has three member objects; a reference to the world, a reference to the partitioning, and a coarray object in which is stores the data. The local size of this coarray is the number of local elements that we have been assigned according to the partitioning; as obtained by local_count . With this constructor, all elements are default initialized to zero. For completeness, we add some accessors and utility functions to our vector class: auto size () const { return data_ . size (); } auto global_size () const { return partitioning_ . global_size (); } bulk :: world world () const { return world_ ; } bulk :: partitioning 1 partitioning () const { return partitioning_ ; } auto begin () { return data_ . begin (); } auto end () { return data_ . end (); } This allows us to query the size of the vector, to obtain the communication world in which it is defined, the partitioning, and to use it as a generic container. With the vector object in place, we are ready to define our first BSP algorithm; the inner product computation. psc::dot : the inner product of two vectors Computing the inner product is fairly straightforward. We assume that the vectors are partitioned in the same manner. The algorithm proceeds in two steps. First, every processor computes the inner product of its local elements. Second, the local results are shared with an all-to-all broadcast and then accumulated resulting in the global result. There are multiple ways to achieve this using Bulk, but an elegent way is to use bulk::foldl over a bulk::var , which works as follows. Consider a distributed variable x . We can interpret x as a virtual 1D array, where the index in the index into the array corresponds to a processor id. s s 0 0 1 1 2 2 p - 1 p - 1 x x(0) x(1) x(2) x(p - 1) A left fold over a 1D array takes some binary operation + , and computes the reduction of the array using this operation: auto foldl = (((( x ( 0 ) + x ( 1 )) + x ( 2 )) + ...) + x ( p - 1 )) For the inner product, we actually want to use the sum as the binary operation, but if T would be for example a bool , we can also use an AND operation , and a left fold would check if all local values are set to true . With the definition of a left fold in place, we are ready to describe the inner product algorithm. template typename T T dot ( const vector T x , const vector T y ) { bulk :: var T result ( x . world ()); for ( auto i = 0u ; i x . size (); ++ i ) { result += x [ i ] * y [ i ]; } auto alpha = bulk :: foldl ( result , []( auto lhs , auto rhs ) { lhs += rhs ; }); return alpha ; } Our template function dot takes two vectors, x and y , as input. The local results are stored in a distributed variable result , defined in the same world as the vectors. By a local computation, we set the local image of result to the correct value. Next, we call foldl on the distributed array result , and as binary operation we use a anonymous function that adds a value to another one. Finally, we return the result of this computation. There are other ways in which we could have implemented this algorithm. The communication pattern used (an all-to-all broadcast followed by a reduction) is so common that has a special implementation in Bulk, but the communication could also have been done manually. In any case, the end result is a generic parallel inner product that works on a vector regardless of its element type T , its size, or the partitioning that is employed. psc::sort : sorting a vector Next, we consider an example that is much more involved sorting a vector. While for the inner product algorithm we did not need to assume a specific partitioning (only that both vectors involved employed the same one), we will choose a specific partitioning for sorting: a block partitioning. The following example shows how the parallel sorting algorithm is called by a user. auto pi = bulk :: block_partitioning 1 ({ size }, { p }); auto v = psc :: vector int ( world , pi ); psc :: sort ( v ); The parallel sorting algorithm we will implement is a distributed version of regular sample sorting. When the algorithm terminates, the result is a coarray where each element has roughly the same number of elements, every local array is sorted, and all elements on processor s t s > t are bigger than those on t t . The algorithm consists of the following steps. Sorting the local vector . First, the local elements are sorted using any sequential sorting algorithm. Choosing and communicating p samples . Next, we identify p p equidistant samples. These p p elements are broadcast to all other processors. Finding global splitters . Every processor now has p^2 p^2 samples, which are sorted sequentially. From these samples, p p global equidistant samples are taken. These global samples define the splitters . A processor s s is responsible for a chunk of elements S_s \\leq x S_{s + 1} S_s \\leq x < S_{s + 1} , where S_i S_i are the splitters. Identify local blocks . For all the local elements, the responsible processor is identified. Because the local array is sorted, the elements that have to be sent to a fixed processor t t are a consecutive block of the local array. Communicate blocks . Every block is sent to the appropriate processor. Merge the (individually sorted) blocks . Each processor now has p p blocks, which are all individually sorted. Using a merge sort routine the resulting sorted block can be computed efficiently. These steps can be implemented in Bulk as follows. First, sorting the local vector can be done simply by using the sorting routine from the standard library. template typename T bulk :: coarray T sort ( vector T x ) { // 1. Sorting the local vector std :: sort ( x . begin (), x . end ()); // ... Next, we identify and communicate the local samples. Here, sample is a sequential routine that simply returns a number equidistant samples from an array. Also, blocked_merge takes an array consisting of a number of blocks that are individually sorted, and an array containing the sizes of the blocks, and sorts them together. In this case, after communicating, each processor has p p sorted blocks that are all of size p p . // 2. Choosing and communicating samples auto local_samples = sample ( x , p ); auto samples = bulk :: coarray T ( world , p * p ); for ( int t = 0 ; t p ; ++ t ) { samples ( t )[{ s * p , ( s + 1 ) * p }] = local_samples ; } world . sync (); blocked_merge ( samples , std :: vector int ( p , p )); Now each processor has the same p^2 p^2 sorted samples, and we use it to compute the splitters. We set the upper limit for the final processor to \\infty \\infty . // 3. Finding global splitters auto splitters = sample ( samples , p ); splitters . push_back ( std :: numeric_limits T :: max ()); Next we want to split our local data up into chunks that each go to a different processor. We can write a simple sequential routine that does this, for example: // 4. Identify local blocks int idx = 0 ; int previous = 0 ; std :: vector int block_sizes ( p ); for ( int t = 0 ; t p ; ++ t ) { while ( idx ( int ) x . size () x [ idx ] splitters [ t + 1 ]) { ++ idx ; } block_sizes [ t ] = idx - previous ; previous = idx ; } Now, block_sizes(t) is the size of the local chunk that is to be sent to processor t . Next, we communicate the chunks. // 5. Communicate chunks auto block_starts = std :: vector int ( p ); std :: partial_sum ( block_sizes . begin (), block_sizes . end () - 1 , block_starts . begin () + 1 ); auto q = bulk :: queue T [] ( world ); for ( int t = 0 ; t p ; ++ t ) { q ( t ). send ( std :: vector ( x . begin () + block_starts [ t ], x . begin () + block_starts [ t ] + block_sizes [ t ])); } world . sync (); Next, we first compute some information about the blocks: their sizes, and where they start. We define a coarray with the appropriate local size, and copy the chunks in to it. Finally, we perform a blocked_merge on the received chunks, and return the resulting coarray. // 6. Merge the (individually sorted) blocks auto receive_sizes = std :: vector int ( p ); std :: transform ( q . begin (), q . end (), receive_sizes . begin (), []( const auto chunk ) { return chunk . size (); }); auto receive_starts = std :: vector int ( p ); std :: partial_sum ( receive_sizes . begin (), receive_sizes . end () - 1 , receive_starts . begin () + 1 ); auto total = std :: accumulate ( receive_sizes . begin (), receive_sizes . end (), 0 ); auto ys = bulk :: coarray T ( world , total ); auto t = 0u ; for ( const auto chunk : q ) { std :: copy ( chunk . begin (), chunk . end (), ys . begin () + receive_starts [ t ++ ]); } blocked_merge ( ys , receive_sizes ); return ys ; Instead of a coarray, we could also return a vector with an irregular block partitioning , where the resulting sizes of the local array define the partitioning. psc::matrix class: distributed dense matrix Our class for a distributed dense matrix is a lot like the class we defined for a distributed dense vector. The main difference is in the data, which is now two-dimensional instead of one-dimensional. We will also choose a associate a Cartesian partitioning, and assume our p p processors are virtually laid out in a grid of size N \\times M N \\times M . The head of the class looks as follows: namespace psc { template typename T class matrix { //... We construct the matrix as follows: private : bulk :: world world_ ; bulk :: cartesian_partitioning 2 , 2 partitioning_ ; bulk :: coarray T data_ ; public : matrix ( bulk :: world world , bulk :: cartesian_partitioning 2 , 2 partitioning , T value = 0 ) : world_ ( world ), partitioning_ ( partitioning ), data_ ( world_ , partitioning . local_count ( world_ . rank ()), value ) {} // ... Note the Cartesian partitioning which has a 2 dimensional data space as well as a 2 dimensional grid space. Next, we provide a limited number of member functions: T at ( bulk :: index_type 2 index ); auto partitioning (); auto world (); auto rows () { return partitioning_ . global_size ()[ 0 ]; } auto cols () { return partitioning_ . global_size ()[ 1 ]; } Here, at provides a reference to the matrix element with local index index . We provide rows and cols function for convenience, which forward the information from the partitioning. psc::lu : parallel in-place LU decomposition Now that we have a distributed matrix class, we are ready to implement a parallel LU decomposition routine. The parallel LU algorithm consists of the following steps. Find pivot Find, and communicate local maximum with processor column . Find global maximum element . Communicate global maximum with processor row . Swap rows Communicate permutation update . Update permutation vector . Communicate rows r and k . Swap rows r and k . Matrix update Communicate pivot . Scale column . Communicate row k and column k . Update bottom right block . We will use a two-dimensional processor numbering, obtained as follows: auto [ s , t ] = psi . multi_rank ( world . rank ()); Here, psi is a cartesian_partitioning . We will not discuss the majority of sequential computations here, but they are given in the full example source code. We will show the body of the loop over k , which ranges from 0 to n - 1 where n is the matrix size. We assume the local maximum in column k is at row r_s and has value local_max . Then communicating with the local processor column can be done as follows: // (1) Communicate maximum element with local processor column if ( psi . owner ( 1 , k ) == t ) { for ( auto u = 0 ; u psi . grid ()[ 0 ]; ++ u ) { pivot_rows ( psi . rank ({ u , t }))[ s ] = r_s ; pivot_values ( psi . rank ({ u , t }))[ s ] = local_max ; } } Here, pivot_rows and pivot_cols are two coarrays that are used to store all the local values. From these local maximums, the global maximums are found, and these can be communicated to the local processor row as follows. Afterwards, all processors know the pivot row r (stored inside a bulk::var int ). // (3) Communicate global maximum with local processor row if ( psi . owner ( 1 , k ) == t ) { for ( auto v = 0 ; v psi . grid ()[ 1 ]; ++ v ) { r ( psi . rank ({ s , v })) = pivot_rows [ best_index ]; } world . sync (); We now want to swap rows k and r . First, we want to make sure our bookkeeping is up to date, and swap the components \\pi_r \\pi_r and \\pi_k \\pi_k of the permutation vector \\pi \\pi . We assume \\pi \\pi is stored in a coarray that is distributed according to the distribution function of the 0\\text{-th} 0\\text{-th} axis. // (4) Communicate permutation update if ( psi . owner ( 0 , k ) == s ) { pi ( psi . rank ({ psi . owner ( 0 , r ), t }))[ psi . local ( 0 , r )] = pi [ psi . local ( 0 , k )]; } if ( psi . owner ( 0 , r ) == s ) { pi ( psi . rank ({ psi . owner ( 0 , k ), t }))[ psi . local ( 0 , k )] = pi [ psi . local ( 0 , r )]; } world . sync (); Now that the permutation bookkeeping is done, we swap rows r and k . For this, we have two coarrays, which use local indices, that act as a buffer. // (6) Communicate row k and r if ( psi . owner ( 0 , k ) == s ) { for ( auto j = 0 ; j psi . local_size ( 1 , t ); ++ j ) { row_swap_k ( psi . rank ({ psi . owner ( 0 , r ), t }))[ j ] = mat . at ({ psi . local ( 0 , k ), j }); } } if ( psi . owner ( 0 , r ) == s ) { for ( auto j = 0 ; j psi . local_size ( 1 , t ); ++ j ) { row_swap_r ( psi . rank ({ psi . owner ( 0 , k ), t }))[ j ] = mat . at ({ psi . local ( 0 , r ), j }); } } We then swap the rows locally. // (7) Locally swap row k and r if ( psi . owner ( 0 , k ) == s ) { for ( auto j = 0 ; j psi . local_size ( 1 , t ); ++ j ) { mat . at ({ psi . local ( 0 , k ), j }) = row_swap_r [ j ]; } } if ( psi . owner ( 0 , r ) == s ) { for ( auto j = 0 ; j psi . local_size ( 1 , t ); ++ j ) { mat . at ({ psi . local ( 0 , r ), j }) = row_swap_k [ j ]; } } After swapping, we know the pivot element. This element is used to scale column k , so the processor that owns it should communicate it to its processor column. // (8) Communicate pivot if ( psi . owner ({ k , k }) == world . rank ()) { for ( auto u = 0 ; u psi . grid ()[ 0 ]; ++ u ) { pivot ( psi . rank ({ u , t })) = mat . at ( psi . local ({ k , k })); } } world . sync (); Next, the column is scaled. // (9) Scale column if ( psi . owner ( 1 , k ) == t ) { // local row index, local col size, loop for ( auto i = ls [ k ]; i psi . local_size ( 0 , s ); ++ i ) { mat . at ({ i , psi . local ( 1 , k )}) /= pivot ; } } For the matrix update, the row k and column k , to the right of and below the diagonal, should be communicated to the processors that require it. This is done using horizontal and vertical communication. Here, col_k and row_k are two coarrays that act as a buffer. // (10) Horizontal, communicate column k if ( psi . owner ( 1 , k ) == t ) { for ( auto v = 0 ; v psi . grid ()[ 1 ]; ++ v ) { auto target_rank = psi . rank ({ s , v }); for ( auto i = 0 ; i psi . local_size ( 0 , s ); ++ i ) { col_k ( target_rank )[ i ] = mat . at ({ i , psi . local ( 1 , k )}); } } } world . sync (); // (10b) Vertical, communicate row k if ( psi . owner ( 0 , k ) == s ) { for ( auto u = 0 ; u psi . grid ()[ 0 ]; ++ u ) { auto target_rank = psi . rank ({ u , t }); for ( auto j = 0 ; j psi . local_size ( 1 , t ); ++ j ) { row_k ( target_rank )[ j ] = mat . at ({ psi . local ( 0 , k ), j }); } } } world . sync (); Finally, we finish our matrix update. // (11) Update bottom right block for ( auto i = ls [ k ]; i psi . local_size ( 0 , s ); ++ i ) { for ( auto j = qs [ k ]; j psi . local_size ( 1 , t ); ++ j ) { mat . at ({ i , j }) -= col_k [ i ] * row_k [ j ]; } }","title":"Parallel Scientific Computing"},{"location":"psc/#introduction","text":"Large scale problems are common in scientific computing.

The algorithms we consider are those explained in Parallel Scientific Computing by Rob Bisseling . Implementations of these algorithms in BSPlib can be found in BSPedupack . Our discussion is stand-alone, however the focus is on the implementation of these algorithms in Bulk, and not the derivation or detailed description of the algorithms. The result of our efforts will be a library that contains support for important objects in parallel scientific computing: Distributed vector Distributed matrix (dense and sparse) The algorithms we will implement are (in order): Computing the inner product of two vectors Sorting a vector Computing the LU decomposition of a matrix Our intentions are educational, we will strive to design simple implementations of the algorithm and will not optimize for specific hardware, or e.g. exploit hybrid systems. Although we do not develop the algorithms for maximum performance, we will make sure that all our algorithms exhibit good scaling behavior.

In this case, the components of the vector are integers. A psc::vector is defined as follows. namespace psc { template typename T class vector { //... Everything we define will be in a parallel scientific computing ( psc ) namespace. We make a generic implementation, that works for any T .

The local size of this coarray is the number of local elements that we have been assigned according to the partitioning; as obtained by local_count . With this constructor, all elements are default initialized to zero. For completeness, we add some accessors and utility functions to our vector class: auto size () const { return data_ . size (); } auto global_size () const { return partitioning_ . global_size (); } bulk :: world world () const { return world_ ; } bulk :: partitioning 1 partitioning () const { return partitioning_ ; } auto begin () { return data_ . begin (); } auto end () { return data_ . end (); } This allows us to query the size of the vector, to obtain the communication world in which it is defined, the partitioning, and to use it as a generic container. With the vector object in place, we are ready to define our first BSP algorithm; the inner product computation.","title":"the psc::vector class: the humble beginnings of our library"},{"location":"psc/#pscdot-the-inner-product-of-two-vectors","text":"Computing the inner product is fairly straightforward. We assume that the vectors are partitioned in the same manner. The algorithm proceeds in two steps. First, every processor computes the inner product of its local elements. Second, the local results are shared with an all-to-all broadcast and then accumulated resulting in the global result. There are multiple ways to achieve this using Bulk, but an elegent way is to use bulk::foldl over a bulk::var , which works as follows. Consider a distributed variable x . We can interpret x as a virtual 1D array, where the index in the index into the array corresponds to a processor id. s s 0 0 1 1 2 2 p - 1 p - 1 x x(0) x(1) x(2) x(p - 1) A left fold over a 1D array takes some binary operation + , and computes the reduction of the array using this operation: auto foldl = (((( x ( 0 ) + x ( 1 )) + x ( 2 )) + ...) + x ( p - 1 )) For the inner product, we actually want to use the sum as the binary operation, but if T would be for example a bool , we can also use an AND operation , and a left fold would check if all local values are set to true . With the definition of a left fold in place, we are ready to describe the inner product algorithm. template typename T T dot ( const vector T x , const vector T y ) { bulk :: var T result ( x . world ()); for ( auto i = 0u ; i x . size (); ++ i ) { result += x [ i ] * y [ i ]; } auto alpha = bulk :: foldl ( result , []( auto lhs , auto rhs ) { lhs += rhs ; }); return alpha ; } Our template function dot takes two vectors, x and y , as input. The local results are stored in a distributed variable result , defined in the same world as the vectors. By a local computation, we set the local image of result to the correct value. Next, we call foldl on the distributed array result , and as binary operation we use a anonymous function that adds a value to another one. Finally, we return the result of this computation. There are other ways in which we could have implemented this algorithm. The communication pattern used (an all-to-all broadcast followed by a reduction) is so common that has a special implementation in Bulk, but the communication could also have been done manually. In any case, the end result is a generic parallel inner product that works on a vector regardless of its element type T , its size, or the partitioning that is employed.","title":"psc::dot: the inner product of two vectors"},{"location":"psc/#pscsort-sorting-a-vector","text":"Next, we consider an example that is much more involved sorting a vector. While for the inner product algorithm we did not need to assume a specific partitioning (only that both vectors involved employed the same one), we will choose a specific partitioning for sorting: a block partitioning. The following example shows how the parallel sorting algorithm is called by a user. auto pi = bulk :: block_partitioning 1 ({ size }, { p }); auto v = psc :: vector int ( world , pi ); psc :: sort ( v ); The parallel sorting algorithm we will implement is a distributed version of regular sample sorting.

Hello bulk::world ! We start out with the obligatory Hello World! in Bulk , and subsequently explain the code line-by-line. In this code we will use the MPI backend, but everything written here is completely general, and guaranteed to work on top of any conforming Bulk backend. #include bulk/bulk.hpp #include bulk/backends/mpi/mpi.hpp int main () { bulk :: mpi :: environment env ; env . spawn ( env . available_processors (), []( auto world ) { auto s = world . rank (); auto p = world . active_processors (); world . log ( Hello world from processor %d / %d! , s , p ); }); } On lines 1 and 2 we include the library, and the backend of our choosing (in our case MPI). On line 5, we initialize an environment , which sets up the parallel or distributed system. On line 6, we spawn the SPMD section of our program within the environment. The first argument denotes the number of processors that we want to run the section on, while the second argument provides a function-like object (here a C++ lambda function) that is executed on the requested number of processors. This function obtains a bulk::world object, which it can use to communicate with other processors. For convenience we suggest to alias the processor identifier (or rank) to s and the total number of processes that are spawned to p . As shown in the example, these can be obtained from world using world.rank() and world.active_processors() respectively. Communication between processors Next, we look at some basic forms of communication between processors. The main way to talk to other processors, is by using variables. A variable is created as follows: auto x = bulk :: var T ( world ); Here, T is the type of the variable, for example an int . Values can be assigned to the (local) variable: x = 5 ; The reason to use such a distributed variable, is that a processor can write to a remote image of a variable. bulk :: put ( world . next_rank (), 4 , x ); // or the short-hand: x ( world . next_rank ()) = 4 ; This will overwrite the value of the variable x on the next logical processor (i.e. processor (s + 1) % p ) with 4 . We can obtain the value of a remote image using: auto y = bulk :: get ( world . next_rank (), x ); // or the short-hand: auto y = x ( world . next_rank ()). get (); Here, y is a bulk::future object. A future object does not immediately hold the remote value of x , but after a future call to world.sync() , we can extract the remote value out of y . world . sync (); auto x_next = y . value (); Coarrays Coarrays are a convenient way to store, and manipulate distributed data. We provide a coarray that is modeled after Coarray Fortran . Arrays are initialized and used as follows: auto xs = bulk :: coarray int ( world , s ); xs ( 3 )[ 2 ] = 1 ; Here, we create a coarray of varying local size (each processor holds s many elements). Next we write the value 1 to the element with local index 2 on processor with index 3 . Algorithmic skeletons Bulk comes equipped with a number of higher-level functions, also known as algorithmic skeletons . For example, say we want to compute the dot-product of two coarrays, then we write this as: auto xs = bulk :: coarray int ( world , s ); auto ys = bulk :: coarray int ( world , s ); // fill xs and ys with data auto result = bulk :: var int ( world ); for ( int i = 0 ; i s ; ++ i ) { result . value () += xs [ i ] * ys [ i ]; } // reduce to find global dot product auto alpha = bulk :: foldl ( result , []( int lhs , int rhs ) { lhs += rhs ; }); Here we first compute the local inner product, and finally use the higher-level function bulk::foldl result. Another example is finding a maximum element over all processors, here max is the maximum value found locally: auto maxs = bulk :: gather_all ( world , max ); max = * std :: max_element ( maxs . begin (), maxs . end ());","title":"Tour"},{"location":"tour/#a-tour-of-bulk","text":"On this page we aim to highlight some of the main features of the library, and to give an impression of the overall syntax.","title":"A tour of Bulk"},{"location":"tour/#hello-bulkworld","text":"We start out with the obligatory Hello World! in Bulk , and subsequently explain the code line-by-line.

The most fundamental way of communicating between processors is using distributed variables . The variables can be created as follows: auto x = bulk :: var int ( world ); Here we create a distributed variable that holds an integer. A distributed variable exists on every processor, but can have different values on different processors. These different local copies are referred to as images of the variable. The variable lives within the world of the current SPMD section, and we explicitely write this by passing the world object as a parameter to the variable creation function. While x refers to the local image of a variable, it is identified with images on remote processors by the order in which variables are constructed (which is possible because of the SPMD nature of Bulk programs). This allows us to write to and read from remote images of a variable by simply passing x to communication functions. Bulk synchronous communication The main way to manipulate remote images of variables is using the communication primitives bulk::put and bulk::get for writing and reading respectively. For example, to write the value 1 to the remote image held by the next logical processor, we write: bulk :: put ( world . next_rank (), 1 , x ); To obtain the value of a remote image we write: auto y = bulk :: get ( world . next_rank (), x ); Note Equivalently, we can use the short-hand syntax: x(world.next_rank()) = 1 for putting, and auto y = x(world.next_rank()).get() for getting. Initially, communication is only staged. This means that the values are not valid immediately after the execution of the communication primitives. Instead, they are available in the next section of the program, known as a (BSP) superstep . Supersteps can be viewed as the section of the program within successive calls to world.sync() . This barrier synchronization asserts that all processors have reached that point of the program, and resolves all outstanding communication such as those staged by calls to put and get. After the barrier synchronization returns, all communication staged in the previous superstep is guaranteed to have occurred. In case of put , the remote image now contains the value written to it (assuming that the local processor is the only one who wrote to that specific remote image). For read requests using get , it is slightly more complicated. The type of y is a bulk::future T . A future object is a placeholder, that will contain the correct value in the next superstep. This value can be obtained after the synchronization using: auto value = y.value(); This way of communicating is particularly useful when dealing with simple data objects.
